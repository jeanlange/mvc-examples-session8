# mvc-examples-session8
Wednesday of MVC week!

This is code you can look at to see examples of what we did this Wednesday, which was all about MVC.

We worked on two projects:
1. 750 words clone. In this project (which ya'll worked on yesterday and we just coded interesting parts of today), you are making a post model that counts the words. Go to `/blogs` to see this functionality that we worked on, and check out mostly the `BlogsController` and `Blog.cs` model.
1. Instagram filtering. In this project (which you will work on next!), we showed you how to edit a picture. Go to `/home/GiveMeImage` to see the functionality so far, and check out `HomeController`'s `GiveMeImage` action for the codez.

To get Instagram to run on my Mac, I had to do: `brew install mono-libgdiplus`
